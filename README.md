# NextQL
> Yet another graph query language

Both love and hate GraphQL.
#### Love
* Elimination of N+1 queries
* Async resolve results from multi backends, then combine into single result.

#### Hate
* Text based query? It is so SQL - we back to era of query builder tools.
* Root query and mutation? It is nightmare to convert a tons of REST apis to GraphQL.
* Strong typed. Sorry I not fan of strong typed language.
* Not flexible. Most request features still go nowhere: Annotation, Input interface.
